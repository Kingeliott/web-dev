<h2>Here is Eliott Livolsi's (me) Top 10 Picks of the last 13 years! </h2>
<p>*Outside of my top 3 picks, there is no hierarchy of movie rankings, I love them all!*</p>

<hr /> 
<h3>10. Forrest Gump</h3>
    <p>Quite possibly the most quotable, iconic, and all-american story ever put to the screen. +1000  for Bubba.</p>
<h3>9. The Giver </h3>
    <p>I have not watched this in years, but I vividly remember this being the first movie adaption of a book that I read that felt similar to the source material. (Kinda scared to rewatch it incase it doesn't hold up but alas.)</p>
<h3>8. Parasite </h3>
    <p>The banality of mankind's attempt at a rich life. 100000/10</p>
<h3>7. Babylon </h3>
    <p>I don't do drugs, but if I did, I'd imagine it would be much like this movie</p>
<h3>6. Eternals </h3>
    <p>the movie equivalent of EA making a good fucking game for once but no one likes it because everything else they make is trash. Dope visuals. Dope characters. Dope story. </p>    
<h3>5. Attack The Block</h3>
    <p>I personally hold huge animosity for the british, but this was good. Dr.Who meets Shawn of the dead.<br />(Dr. Who is the only british thing I like)</p>
<h3>4. The Woman King</h3>
    <p>Made me tear up a bit on my first 2 watches. Izogi is one of, if not my favorite character in a movie ever and Viola Davis led an amazing cast full of 100/100 perfomances.</p>
<h3>3. The Raid </h3>
    <p>A non-english action movie that provides an average english dub at the cost of captions. However in exchange for not having to read, you really get to bask in watching people get the absolute snot beat out of them in a manner Ip Man would wince at.</p>
<h3>2. Paprika</h3>
    <p>Once again, I do not do drugs, but if I did. I'd do them all while watching this movie.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: John Wick Series </h3>
    <p>So there's this guy, and he had this dog, and you killed his dog, 3 times, <br />aaaaaaaand <br /> he's behind you with a pencil.</p>
<h3>1. Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Love is the single most powerful force in the universe. Capable of travelling galaxies and time itself.
        <br />  'Forrest Gump' = All For One
        <br />  'Interstellar' = One For All
